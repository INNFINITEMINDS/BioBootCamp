#Day 3 Journal Outline
Start by writing down what you think we are going to learn today and what you hope to learn. What have you learned so far? Are you excited?
Today is a day where if you plan your journal out, you can take notes MUCH more effectively. 

##Programming I Notes
- What makes a computer smart?
- What types of commands do you have to give a computer for it to understand you?
- What is syntax?
- What did you learn about the specific Arduino syntax?
- What is commenting and what is it for?
- What did you learn about variables? How do you name them? What are they for?
- What is the ; for in arduino? Is it special?
- What are arduino functions? {}
- How do you setup an arduino program? 

##Arduino Program Notes
For everyone of your arduino programs, make sure to complete the following.
- Write a description of what the program does.
- Write out the pseudocode of how your program will work
- Draw a diagram of the circuit (if necessary)
- Sketch out how the program will flow
- Start writing code (be sure to save often)
-

##Coding tips
- Be sure to comment a lot! It will help when trying to figure out what your code does later. It also makes it so that someone else that reads your code can understand it.
- Write down any special programming words and structures that we learn. Box those and make them easy to find in the future.
