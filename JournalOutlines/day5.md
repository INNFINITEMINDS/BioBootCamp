# Day 5 Journal Outline
Woah, that's it ladies and gentlemen. The week is over! We have come a **long** way and I am proud of you. I think that you should be proud of yourselves too. Maybe spend a few seconds to start todays journal by writing down some things that you hope to learn today to round out your experience.

## Heart Physiology Notes
Important things to note:
* What does ECG stand for?
* Specifically, what does an ECG measure?
* What does your heart do?
* What is a p-wave and what does it correspond to?
* What is the qrs-complex and what does it correspond to?
* What is the t-wave and what does it correspond to?
* How many chambers is your heart?
* What are atria?
* What are ventricles?

## Old-School ECG Notes 
* What is special about electrodes? Do they have anything special in them?
* How do you calculate your heart-rate from an ECG tracing?

## Your ECG Program
Make sure you "hack" this program. Change colors, make it your own. If you are feeling VERY ambitious, see if you can figure out an algorithm to add R-Wave detection. From that you can calculate the heart rate from this graph.

## Reflection Entry 5 
*This is your last opportunity to reflect.* What did you learn this week? Did you have fun? Is there something that you did that you wish you didn't? Did you meet anyone fun?
