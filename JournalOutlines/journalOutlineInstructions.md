# How to use the Journal Outlines
To help you take better notes, we have included a journal outline that you can use on each day. You should use these outlines as a way to help highlight what is important to learn on each day.
Keep in mind that you do not need to copy everything down from the slides. Instead concentrating on getting enough information to answer the questions posed in the journal outlines. Further more, when Dr. B asks if there are any questions, that is your opportunity to scan the journal outline for the day and ask for clarification on any of those topics.

## Journaling tips
- Read the outline before class starts to get a feel for what we are going to be learning that day and to help you to start thinking about how to organize your notes.
- Start everyday by writing the main thing that we are going to learn that day in big letters.
- Start everyday on a new full spread.
- Don't be afraid of whitespace! There is plenty of pages in the book.
- Draw LOTS of pictures. Like a weird amount of pictures. It's fun, and they are worth a thousand words and all.
- Write down any questions that may pop into your head so that you can ask them later.
- Feel free to cross out questions that you have answered on any of the outlines. That will help you keep track of where we are during the day. For the most part the outlines are written in chronological order but not necessarily.
