# How to use the Speed of Light Files
You will notice that there are 4 different Speed of Light games available in this folder.
1) speedOfLight.ino
2) speedOfLightBeginner.ino
3) speedOfLightIntermediate.ino
4) speedOfLightAdvanced.ino

These all correspond to different levels of completed code. Remember, you are here to LEARN! *I highly recommend that you start by trying to make the game **all on your own!*** This will help you even if you struggle a little bit and can't get it finished. *You have to struggle in order to learn.*

If you get stuck, *you should look at the speedOfLightAdvanced.ino file first.* It is a good outline of how I implemented the program. It includes all of the comments from my final version of the file so you should be able to start filling in the blanks.

From there you can continue down the list. The speedOfLightIntermediate.ino file will be a little bit more completed, the speedOfLightBeginner.ino file a little bit more, and the speedOfLight.ino file is totally finished and working.
