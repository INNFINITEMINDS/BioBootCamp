Welcome to the github page for the bioengineering bootcamp.
You can find all of the information that is used during the weeklong summer bootcamp on this page.

**The intent of this repository is NOT to have you copy the code contained here**
The intent IS to allow you to have a reference when the week is done. It is up to you to use self restraint and be honest.
